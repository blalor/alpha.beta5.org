Long day yesterday and no service in Black Canyon National Park where I camped last night. Today’s destination is Wendover, UT and the Bonneville salt flats (and a bed, and a shower). There is SO MUCH more to see in Colorado, another trip is warranted. But I’m afraid today will be mostly interstate. The altitude, dry air, and high temps (plus 5 straight days in the saddle) are taking their toll.
