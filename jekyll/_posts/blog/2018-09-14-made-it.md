I almost skipped the speedway tonight. It’d been a long, _hot_ day, and I have been looking forward to a bed, shower, and air conditioning for most of it. But I couldn’t resist. 

Thanks to Lori working security for not just letting me get to the sign, but for taking this otherwise-woulda-been-a-selfie.
