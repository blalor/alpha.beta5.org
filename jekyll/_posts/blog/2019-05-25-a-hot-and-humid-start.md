I hit the road this morning, almost on schedule, leaving just a little after 6am.  Morning rides through the country are one of my favorite things. The smells are much more noticeable in the cool, damp air.  And thereâ€™s (generally) less traffic.  221 from Lynchburg to Roanoke looked pretty good on the map, but it was really just divided highway; south of Roanoke, however, it got fun and interesting: no longer divided, some really twisty sections (like shockingly twisty), and nice views.  I stayed with it until lunch beckoned and I ran south to Fancy Gap ðŸŽ© where I had an excellent reuben at The Gap Deli.  From there I took the Blue Ridge Parkway until I got bored with the traffic and the speed limit (which doesnâ€™t take long on Memorial Day weekendâ€¦) and split off toward Glade Valley for gas.  At that point I was starting to feel the heat (upper 80s) and Iâ€™d already been in the saddle for the better part of 7 hours, so I opted for interstates to get to Asheville.  That only sort of worked: it took less time than back roads, but at the expense of frequent stop-n-go traffic and higher temperatures at the lower elevations.  I saw 100Â° for a while, and it was above 90Â° for most of the afternoon.

Iâ€™m staying at the Smokey Mountains Hostel in Bryson City.  Clean, friendly folks, and walking distance from a brewery with a taco truck and around the corner from an ice cream shoppe.  Could be worse.
