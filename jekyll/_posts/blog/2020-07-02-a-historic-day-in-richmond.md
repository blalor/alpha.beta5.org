What a month itâ€™s been here, with more than 25 days of protests against police brutality and systemic racism, met by â€” of course â€” police brutality. But protests do work, and weâ€™re starting to see change, even if itâ€™s just of the superficial and symbolic type. The first of the memorials to the Lost Cause of the Civil War has been brought down by the government (but not before protesters tore down several on their own, first). Today started out hot, humid, and clear, but then some amazing summertime storms rolled through. I donâ€™t think a single onlooker left because of the deluge, tho.
