Up early this morning, made a cup of coffee, packed up camp, and had breakfast at the Tamarack CafÃ© in Inlet.  More fun roads as I pushed East, but befouled by traffic and (SO MUCH) road construction.  Really pretty riding around the lakes and streams of this part of NY.  If they finish the construction the roads will be awesome next spring!

Around noon I got my first ferry of the trip, from Essex, NY to Charlotte, VT, crossing Lake Champlain.  A bit cool, but otherwise perfect with blue skies and puffy clouds.  Recognizing that I'd packed for far warmer weather I headed toward Burlington to try to get a more appropriate base layer; Dick's failed me, REI is "coming soon" (Burlington doesn't have an REI, yetâ€½), and I quickly tired of the traffic and malls, so I gave up and pointed myself toward Maine again.  Typically for me, after taking my time in the morning and early afternoon, I started feeling some (entirely self-supplied) pressure to make more progress, so I hopped on the interstate for a bit toward Barre and then headed for the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  I'm generally only vaguely aware of road names and route numbers; once I learn my way around an area I navigate by feel: I was delighted when I realized I was going past some of the old MINIsOnTop haunts, like the Town & Country motel.  

I wound my way across NH and Maine, through Augusta, and to my final destination near Rockland to meet MINI friends Blaine and Monica at the amazing [CafÃ© Miranda](https://www.cafemiranda.com/).  They graciously offered to put me up for the night; it was a long day and this was a great end to it.  

Tomorrow: ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦!
