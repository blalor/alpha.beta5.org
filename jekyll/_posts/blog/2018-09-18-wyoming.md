I’m staying in Rock Springs, WY tonight. It was an uneventful — if windy — ride from Wendover. I’m always fascinated when I see the landscape change around state lines. Even without seeing the border on the map I knew I was approaching Wyoming as the terrain changed from red mesas and desert to rocky buttes and huge sweeping vistas. The fires in Utah (I’m presuming mostly the Pole Creek Fire I saw last week, which continues to grow) are sending smoke over 150 miles to this area. It’s making for some beautiful skies, but at a cost. 

I was disappointed that the Greater Green River Intergalactic Spaceport doesn’t have a sign.
