Today was the last full day of racing. The line for the 130 club was longer than any other: that’s great for the organization, and a little frustrating for those of us in it (it took 3+ hours to get in each of my two runs). But I spent the downtime chatting with my fellow racers, and they’re a fun bunch. 

My first run today was 118.7mph with zero wind, a touch faster than yesterday. I removed the wind deflectors for the hand guards and the top box. With all the time I had before the next one I swapped to a -1 tooth sprocket and removed the windscreen. The result: 118.8. But there was a 9mph headwind. The bike definitely pulled harder all the way through 5th gear and into 6th.

I have two runs left tomorrow and my plan is to be on the salt at 7:30am to make them count. Racing is done at noon, however, and I need to start heading back East. 

Thanks to Reia for the photo; to Jonathan, JJ, Augie, Jimmy, Carlos, Sam, Steph, and Dave for keeping me entertained; and to the folks from San Jose BMW for the tool loan.
