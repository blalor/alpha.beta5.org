I know it’s right in the name, but the Bonneville Salt Flats make Kansas feel hilly. This was the first time my throttle lock would actually hold a speed (no cruise control; this widget just clamps to the throttle tube and rests on the brake lever). 

Anyway, not long after the sun finished blinding me it made for a very pretty sunset, and the pattern in the clouds stretched so far across the sky I really couldn’t see the whole thing at once. This part of Utah is just so wide open and vast.
