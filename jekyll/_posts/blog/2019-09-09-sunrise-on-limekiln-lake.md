Shortish day from the Finger Lakes yesterday. I spent Saturday night and yesterday morning visiting my mom, so Iâ€™ve covered a little less ground than I typically do on travel days. Iâ€™m working my way toward Nova Scotia, but my initial plan had to be modified to avoid Hurricane Dorian, which hit Cape Breton just about the time Iâ€™d intended to be there. So Iâ€™m sort of reversing the route and taking the long way through NY, VT, NH, and ME, sort of an unintended tour of New England (Iâ€™ll probably touch the rest on the way home).  I donâ€™t have any particular points of interest on the way, so Iâ€™m just trying to take scenic routes and try not to hate the GPS too much (itâ€™s a fussy, persnickety thing). 
Iâ€™m loving the new bike, a 2007 BMW R1200RT. It looks one step removed from a Goldwing, but moves and handles well, and does a good job coping with the weight of all the crap Iâ€™m carrying.
