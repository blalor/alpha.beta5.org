VIN: `JH2SD044XHK100172`  
23,700mi

I'm the original owner of this fine motorcycle, purchased new in June 2017 from Honda House in Richmond, VA.  It's taken me on some fantastic adventures, and has been the best bike I've ever had, but it no longer fits in the stable.

This is not a garage queen: it's been properly adventured.  But it's also been cared for.  I invested in protection to the body, frame, and cockpit to ensure I'd be able to ride home when my talent eventually ran out.  The crash bars and skid plate from Outback Motortek and Ultimate Handguards from Highway Dirt Bikes have worked incredibly well.  The Seat Concepts seat is comfortable enough for multiple 14-hour back-to-back days.  Windscreens from California Scientific and Powerbronze, plus the original stock one, plus an MRA X-creen (yes, that's how it's spelled), give options from gale force winds to light breeze, with commensurate cooling, and the winglets adapted from the 2018/2019 Africa Twin Adventure Sports provide a smoother and wider pocket of air.  A home-made-but-not-too-ugly rubber wind deflector keeps the air that flows up the fork tunnel from disturbing your helmet.  Oxford heated grips make for comfortable riding on cool days, and the fused-and-relay'd plug for heated gear provides power without worries about killing the battery.  (Two additional switched leads are available on the Eastern Beaver 3CS harness for additional accessories.)  The Tusk pannier racks are not quite as straight as they were when new, but are still fully functional and work well with Mosko Moto Backcountry 35 bags.  An SW-Motech rear plate is mounted on the back and works well as a base for Pelican-style waterproof cases, or just a place to strap down a bag.  A pair of Kriega rack loops are attached to the tail and a custom strap on the underside of the passenger seat makes it easy to mount Kriega US-10 and larger drypacks on the rear.  It's also possible to use those straps to attach Kriega throw-over bags like the Overlander 30, without using the pannier racks.  A windscreen brace from Vlad Voiculescu ensures accessories mounted above the instruments don't bounce around and don't stress the windscreen bracket.  Larger foot pegs are much more comfortable when standing for extended periods, and also provide some space to move around when sitting.  A stronger Camel ADV side stand is fitted and the original included.

All maintenance has been performed by me, after the initial break-in service done by the dealership.  I purchased an extended warranty that ran out this past June: I never needed it.  All service is up to date, with the exception of replacing the coolant.  The oil was changed less than 2,000mi ago.  The new chain and sprockets have merely tens of miles on them; while the chain was worn after 23,000 miles, the sprockets looked good, but I replaced them anyway (the originals are included, along with a 1-tooth-smaller front sprocket that was barely used).  New air filters were installed at the same time as the chain and sprockets.  The Shinko 705 tires have about 4,000 miles on them, and at least that many more miles ahead of them. Also included are a set of big-block Shinko E-804/805 tires that have done about 3,200mi and still have plenty of life remaining.

This is a fantastic, well-equipped, nicely-setup adventure/touring bike whose greatest adventures are still ahead of it underneath the next rider.  Maybe it'll return to Colorado for a camping trip in Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park?  Or perhaps a run up the MABDR to see the fall colors?  Or maybe back to Austin for the next US round of MotoGP?  How about the Trans-America Trail?  Whatever you choose, this Africa Twin will take you there and bring you and your memories back home!
