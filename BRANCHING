BRANCHING

Should allow importing upstream theme changes while keeping content-specific
commits on their own timeline.

In theory:

* "<theme>" branch containing original theme files
* "<theme>-customized" branch containing my customizations to the theme
* "master" branch with `--no-ff` merges from "<theme>-customized"
